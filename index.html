       <h3>College years</h3>
        <p>The <a href="Firstwork.html"><i>New yorker</i></a> noted that the time Zuckerberg began classes at <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg"><b>Harvard</b></a> in 2002,he had already
            achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy".He studied <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg"><b>psychology</b></a> and <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg"><b>computer science</b></a> and belonged
            to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg"><b>Alpha epilson Pi</b></a> and <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg"><b>Kirkland House.</b></a>In his <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg"><b>sophomore</b></a> year, he wrote a program that
            he
            called
            CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students
            and
            also to
            help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called <a
                href="attributes\links.html"><b>Facemash</b></a>
            that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit,
            Zuckerberg's
            roommate
            at the time, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:
            <center>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the
                student dorms.
                At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and females. Visitors to the
                site
                had to
                choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.</center>
        <p>The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had
            overwhelmed
            one of Harvard's <a href="index.html"><b>network switches</b></a> and prevented students from accessing the
            Internet. In addition, many students complained
            that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologised publicly, and the student paper
            ran
            articles stating
            that his site was "completely improper". </p>
        <p>The following semester, in january 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. On February 4,
            2004,
            Zuckerberg launched
            "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.</p>
        <p>Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors,<a href="Firstwork.html"><b>Cameron
                    Winklevoss</b></a>,<b>Tyler Winklevoss</b>,and <b>Divya Narendra</b>,
            accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network
            called <b>HarvardConnection.com</b>,
            while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.The three complained to <b>The Harvard
                Crimson</b>, and the newspaper began an
            investigation in response.</p>
        <p>Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against
            Zuckerberg
            that resulted in a settlement.
            The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares.</p>
        <p>Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project. In January 2014, he
            recalled:
            <center>I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two afterâ€”I opened up the
                first version of Facebook at the time
                I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never
                thought
                that we'd be the ones to help do it.
                And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.</center>
        <p>On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement Day, Zuckerberg, after giving a <b>commencement
                speech</b>,received an honorary degree from Harvard.</p>

            <Li>In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I taught a new course, Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 /
                CS
                1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites,
                and will cover a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</Li>

                Cambridge
                University Press, 2010.
                This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the
                course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites.
                To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.

                parts for our graduate algorithms course.</li>
